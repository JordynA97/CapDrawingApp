# CapDrawingApp
Drawing app for capstone project

Authors: Jordyn Antinore and Wyatt Lynch

Purpose: Drawing app that does the following
  1. saves users drawimg in Firebase
  2. Lets user pick a template overlay if they want to.
  3. sends an email to the user with their image. 
  4. array sent to database needs to be converted to a png when pulled.
  4. once converted image should be animated and put within a scene. 
  
Concerns:
  - storage space for Firebase.
  - we may need to buy a email API if needed, or can possibly do for free? may be limited.
